### Programming Model
**Primitive data types and expressions**. A *data type* is a set of **values **and a set of **operations on those values**. The following four primitive data types are the basis of the Java language:
- Integers, with arithmetic operations (int)
- Real numbers, again with arithmetic operations (double)
- Booleans, the set of values { true, false } with logical operations (boolean)
- Characters, the alphanumeric characters and symbols that you type (char)

A Java program manipulates variables that are named with *identifiers*(标识符). Each variable is associated with a *data type* and stores one of the permissible data-type values. We use expressions to apply the operations associated with each type
